# agnes-bootstrap-assaignment

Responsive site built with bootstrap.

So for this project, I was instructed to build any site of my choice but use bootstrap to build a responsive, mobile-first project. I chose to create a one-page website showing the Beauty Of Africa.

Using Sketch as a tool to draw up the low-fi wireframes of how I wanted the page to look like, the content, image placement, navigation, and buttons.
Then I proceeded with the actual HTML to bring my content to the page and used CSS to give my site life and color. I incorporated Bootstrap as requested.this is a link to the finished website.
